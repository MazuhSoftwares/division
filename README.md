While sharing a payment, how much each people will pay?

## Settimg up locally

First, makre sure you have [Elm installed](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install/elm.html)
in your machine.

Run Elm "reactor" to serve already generated static files:

```sh
make server
```

Open the provided URL and select the `index.html`.

After each change on `src/Main.elm`, re-run this and refresh that page to see it working:

```sh
make build
```

Or just `make` instead (or even `watch -n1 make dev` ðŸ¤«).

## Learning Elm

I know, it's an esoteric language.

As I'm already somewhat experienced in different languages (and functional programming),
I tried to build this without seeing any big previous content
but [official docs](https://guide.elm-lang.org/)
and a [quick video by ElmHax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7oTGURMyVs).

And if you already built cool stuff with Elm before, let me know how I can improve,
because this repository feels "weird" with a bunch of autogenerated stuff versioned.
